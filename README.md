# Welcome to airBnbClone!

https://airbnbclone-bypawan.herokuapp.com/

airBnbClone is a website designed to let users make accommodations around the world.

# Technologies Used
airBnbClone was built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The backend core server and database were created using sequelize and express, respectively. While the HTML (through the use of react) used to structure the app, and CSS was used to style it.

When entering the website, users are able to use the search bar to input criteria based upon their liking to look for available bookings. Once the user registers/logs-in, they are able to make bookings themselves, write reviews for spots other than their own, of course.
